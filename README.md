#Math Captcha

Today's challenge is to write a Captcha system that uses math questions to distinguish humans from bots.

Modified from Ruby Quiz #48 (so don't look at their solution!)

###Challenge Levels:

1. Write a program that randomly generates simple addition questions, such as "What is twenty-five plus three hundred and nine?" The program should take input from a user and return true or false depending to whether their answer is correct.
2. Expand your program to randomly choose from multiple operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.)
3. Expand your program to generate questions in forms that would be easy for a human to answer, but very difficult for a bot to parse. For example: "How much is fifteen-hundred twenty-three, less the amount of non-thumbs on one human hand?"

Ruby Quiz #25 has some nice code that you can appropriate for turning integers into English: http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz25.html
